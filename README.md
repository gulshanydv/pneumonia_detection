Pneumonia Detection Using CNN

Pneumonia is a severe lung infection caused by various pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. It is one of the leading causes of death globally, ranking as the 8th leading cause of death in the U.S. and is particularly deadly for children under the age of five. To combat this disease and save lives, it's essential to leverage technology in healthcare.

Chest X-rays are commonly used to diagnose pneumonia, allowing healthcare professionals to detect infected areas in the lungs. Traditionally, radiologists manually review X-rays and communicate their findings to doctors, but this process can be time-consuming and prone to human error.

The goal of this model is to assist healthcare providers by quickly and accurately identifying whether a person has pneumonia. By using advanced deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we can automate this process with high accuracy. CNNs are capable of training on large datasets of chest X-ray images to make precise predictions, ultimately aiding doctors in diagnosing pneumonia early and accurately.

This model, when trained on a high-quality dataset, can be a valuable tool for doctors, reducing the burden of manual diagnosis and ensuring that patients receive timely treatment.
